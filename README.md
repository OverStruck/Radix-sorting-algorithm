Radix-sorting-algorithm
=======================

[Radix sorting algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_sort) implemented using 2 arrays in C++

This is a visual studio 2013 project (*run the file 'Radix sorting algorithm.sln'*)
It automatically generates a psudo-random array and sorts it.

There are many different kinds of implementations, this is just one of them.

This project was created as practice for a data structures class. I don't claim this to be the best, fastest, or cleanest implementation out there. Feel free to study it/do what ever you want.
